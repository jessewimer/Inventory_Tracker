# Inventory_Tracker
Processes Shopify order data to look for low inventory items, and bulk items that need to be reallocated

This Python script is used to process a CSV file of Shopify product data for a small seed company. Its main purpose is to assist with inventory management by identifying sold out items, and to locate bulk sizes of any given variety that could be reallocated to smaller, sold-out bulk sizes of that same variety. After opening the file, the program scans it and separates actively tracked packet items from actively tracked bulk items. With the packets, it checks low inventory status (<25), and appends to a packet list if so. Bulk items are appended to a separate bulk list. The program then writes information to a new product report CSV file. First, it writes the low inventory packets from the above list. Then it scans the bulk list and looks for larger sized quantities that need reallocation. Finally, it writes out bulk items that are sold out (regardless of size). At this point, a technician can read the report to determine if there is enough seed in stock to warrant increasing the number of packets available for sale for any given variety. An nice addition would be adding an API call to the Shopify store to automate the reallocation of bulk sizes so it did not need to be manually done each time.
